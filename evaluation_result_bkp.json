      "predicted": "500, incorrect loop implementation.",
      "score": 2.0,
      "feedback": "The solution is incorrect. The predicted answer '500' is incorrect. Check the loop logic in your Scratch program. Consider using the formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers: n*(n+1)/2 for optimization."

  "report": {
    "common_errors": "Mathematical errors often involve incorrect understanding or application of basic formulas, as seen with the miscalculation of the sum of natural numbers. Programming errors in Scratch are typically due to improper loop or condition implementations.",
    "weaknesses": "Students show fragility in loop logic within Scratch programming and fundamental mathematical concepts, particularly around arithmetic series and their properties.",
    "recommendations": "1. Reinforce learning on arithmetic series and sums with target-based tasks involving both correct and incorrect solutions to identify and correct errors. 2. Provide additional Scratch puzzles focusing on loops and conditionals, encouraging students to trace their code execution for errors. 3. Encourage self-assessment strategies where students are tasked with creating test cases for their solutions to verify their correctness independently."
