Can you find the right path using these operations to reach the hidden treasure hidden exactly at position 30? Use Scratch to program Alex's journey, mindful of choosing addition or multiplication wisely!",
      "math_reasoning": "To solve this problem, we need to use a combination of addition and multiplication operations to achieve the exact position 30. We start from position 0 and can choose to add or multiply a given step value to reach 30. Let's assume the step values provided are 2, 3, and 5 (common in these gamified settings). Starting from 0, we can add 2 to reach 2. Then multiply by 5 to reach 10. Finally, add 20 (using 4 iterations of adding 5) to reach 30. The steps in Scratch would involve sequential operations involving variables to track Alex's position.",
