    ```json
    insight = {insight}
    ```

    Analyze the provided insight containing feedback on student performance.
    Based on this analysis, generate new math problem statements in English that specifically address the identified weakness.

    The problem statements must:
    1. **Target Weaknesses**:
       - Directly address mathematical concepts or programming logic where students demonstrate fragility.
       - Focus on strengthening skills in areas like arithmetic operations, problem deconstruction, logical reasoning, or constraint handling.
    2. **Be Well-Defined**:
       - Clearly state all conditions, parameters, and operations involved.
       - It must include operations with numbers.
       - Ensure there is a single correct and deterministic solution.
       - Avoid open-ended or ambiguous problem setups.
    3. **Encourage Problem-Solving**:
       - Present scenarios or narratives that engage students and encourage creative thinking.
       - Provide contexts that require logical application of math concepts.
    4. **Integrate Programming Concepts**:
       - Design problems that can be translated into Scratch projects using variables, loops, or conditionals.
       - Reinforce computational thinking by requiring structured approaches to the solution.
    5. **Promote Engagement**:
       - Use gamified or challenge-based scenarios (e.g., solving puzzles, helping characters, achieving goals in stories).
       - Ensure problems are visually and conceptually appealing to children.

    The focus is on creating problems that can be transformed into interactive games in MIT Scratch, enhancing student engagement and addressing specific learning needs.

    This task focuses on generating detailed mathematical solutions for gamified math problems, ensuring both the reasoning process and final solution are clearly presented. For every provided problem statement, the following steps must be performed:

      1. **Validate Clarity and Solvability**:
         - Ensure the problem statement is clear, logically sound, and can be solved mathematically.
         - Verify that the problem structure aligns with its gamified narrative.

      2. **Generate Mathematical Reasoning**:
         - Develop a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.
         - Clearly document each step, including any assumptions or intermediate calculations required to arrive at the solution.

      3. **Produce the Final Solution**:
         - Use the reasoning process to calculate the correct final answer.
         - Present the solution clearly and concisely.
  expected_output: >
    The output must conform to the following Pydantic model:

    ```python
    class MathSolverItem(BaseModel):
        question: str
        math_reasoning: str
        math_solution: str

    class MathSolverResponse(BaseModel):
        items: list[MathSolverItem]
    ```

    Ensure that `items` is a list of `MathSolverItem` objects, where each contains:
      - `question`: The original gamified math problem statement.
      - `math_reasoning`: A detailed explanation of the step-by-step process used to solve the problem.
      - `math_solution`: The correct final answer to the problem.

    This task involves generating simplified Scratch-based implementations for gamified math problems. For each item in the provided list, follow these steps:

      1. **Design and Implement the Scratch Solution**:
         - Generate the reasoning to solve the problem programmatically (scratch_reasoning).
         - Implement the solution as an interactive game using the Scratch programming language in a simplified, high-level, and well-defined JSON block syntax (scratch_solution).
         - Ensure the implementation:
           - Uses only basic Scratch programming blocks, such as variables, conditionals, and loops.
           - Focuses on solving the problem mathematically while aligning with the provided reasoning.
           - Avoids the need for visual details such as sprites or backgrounds.
           - Includes a block of type "say" regarding the final math solution.

      2. **Validate the Implementation**:
         - Ensure that the Scratch implementation:
           - Solves the problem correctly and reaches the math solution using the provided reasoning.
           - Is functional, user-friendly, and suitable for elementary school students.
           - Provides clear and appropriate feedback to the player.
           - Is designed in an educational manner that supports learning objectives.

      3. **Double-Check for Quality**:
         - Perform a final review to confirm the implementation is:
           - Correct in terms of functionality and alignment with the problem statement.
           - Simplified but accurate in its representation of Scratchâ€™s block syntax.
           - Engaging and effective as a learning tool.

    The output must adhere to the following Pydantic model:

    ```python
    class ScratchSolverItem(BaseModel):
        question: str
        math_reasoning: str
        math_solution: str
        scratch_reasoning: str
        scratch_solution: dict

    class ScratchSolverResponse(BaseModel):
        items: list[ScratchSolverItem]
    ```

    Ensure that `items` is a list of `ScratchSolverItem` objects, where each includes:
      - `question`: The original problem statement.
      - `math_reasoning`: The detailed mathematical reasoning provided to solve the problem.

        math_reasoning="To find the product of 3 x 3, multiply the two numbers. The calculation is straightforward: 3 times 3 equals 9.",
        math_solution="3 x 3 = 9",
        scratch_reasoning="In Scratch, Astro collects stars through a loop. Each correct answer to 3 x 3 = 9 increments his star collection until he gathers all 10 stars.",
