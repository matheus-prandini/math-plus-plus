The area of the rectangle is length x width, so w(w + 5) = 480 cm². Expanding the equation gives: w² + 5w = 480. Solving the quadratic equation w² + 5w - 480 = 0 using the quadratic formula w = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)] / 2a, where a = 1, b = 5, and c = -480, leads to: w = [-5 ± sqrt(25 + 1920)] / 2 = [-5 ± sqrt(1945)] / 2.
