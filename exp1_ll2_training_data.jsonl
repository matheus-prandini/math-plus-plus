A loop will continuously check each approached capsule's energy level using conditionals to ensure it meets criteria: div by 2 equals 0 (even), and it's greater than 10. If both are true, Pixel collects it. The collection is tracked by incrementing a 'collected' variable displayed for players to monitor progress towards the goal. A 'say' block provides user feedback at each step, ensuring engagement and correct capsule collection logic.\", \"scratch_solution\": {\"variables\": {\"collected\": 0}, \"blocks\": [{\"event\": \"when green flag clicked\", \"actions\": [{\"type\": \"forever\", \"actions\": [{\"type\": \"if\", \"condition\": {\"operator\": \"key pressed\", \"operand\": \"up arrow\"}, \"actions\": [{\"type\": \"move\", \"direction\": \"up\", \"steps\": 10}]}, {\"type\": \"if\", \"condition\": {\"operator\": \"key pressed\", \"operand\": \"down arrow\"}, \"actions\": [{\"type\": \"move\", \"direction\": \"down\", \"steps\": 10}]}, {\"type\": \"if\", \"condition\": {\"operator\": \"key pressed\", \"operand\": \"right arrow\"}, \"actions\": [{\"type\": \"move\", \"direction\": \"right\", \"steps\": 10}]}, {\"type\": \"if\", \"condition\": {\"operator\": \"key pressed\", \"operand\": \"left arrow\"}, \"actions\": [{\"type\": \"move\", \"direction\": \"left\", \"steps\": 10}]}, {\"type\": \"if\", \"condition\": {\"operator\": \"touching\", \"operand\": \"energy capsule\"}, \"actions\": [{\"type\": \"ask\", \"question\": \"What is the energy level?\"}, {\"type\": \"if\", \"condition\": {\"operator\": \"and\", \"operands\": [{\"operator\": \"=\", \"operands\": [{\"operator\": \"mod\", \"operands\": [{\"value\": \"answer\"}, 2]}, 0]}, {\"operator\": \">\", \"operands\": [{\"value\": \"answer\"}, 10]}]}, \"actions\": [{\"type\": \"change\", \"variable\": \"collected\", \"by\": 1}, {\"type\": \"say\", \"message\": \"Pixel collected an optimal capsule!\"}]}]}, {\"type\": \"if\", \"condition\": {\"operator\": \">=\", \"operands\": [{\"variable\": \"collected\"}, 3]}, \"actions\": [{\"type\": \"say\", \"message\": \"Pixel has collected enough capsules to reach the charging station!\"}]}]}]}]}}"}]}
