      "recommendation": "Training Focus: Emphasize understanding problem requirements and correctly applying mathematical formulas. Example Problem: Provide a problem where students must calculate the internal angles of various polygons and identify the correct polygon based on given criteria. Include a step-by-step guide to solving quadratic equations, ensuring students understand each step of the process."

      "recommendation": "Training Focus: Focus on optimizing Scratch implementations by using loops and conditionals effectively. Example Problem: Create a Scratch project where students must use loops to iterate through a list of numbers and apply conditionals to filter specific values. Encourage students to simplify their logic and use comments to explain their code."

Example Problem: Provide a task where students must convert units using Scratch, requiring them to set up variables and conditionals correctly. Include a guide on how to break down the problem into smaller, manageable parts and translate them into Scratch code."
