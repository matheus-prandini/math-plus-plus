      "recommendation": "Training Focus: Improve reading comprehension and problem analysis skills. Example Problem: Given a word problem, identify and list all constraints before attempting a solution. Practice with problems that have similar wording but different constraints to enhance discernment."

      "error_pattern": "Inefficient use of loops, often using multiple loops where a single loop would suffice.",
      "recommendation": "Training Focus: Learn to optimize loop usage by understanding loop conditions and iterations. Example Problem: Rewrite a Scratch program that uses two nested loops to achieve the same result with a single loop. Provide examples of loop refactoring to demonstrate efficiency gains."
