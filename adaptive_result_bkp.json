      "question": "Welcome to the 'Magic Garden Adventure'! Your task is to help the magic gardener grow flowers by solving a math puzzle and implementing a Scratch game. \n\n**Math Puzzle:** You need to calculate how many flowers are needed to form a perfect rectangle that is `7 flowers wide and 9 flowers long`. Find the total number of flowers required.\n\n**Scratch Game Challenge:** Create a Scratch project where you use a loop to plant the exact number of flowers calculated above. Use a variable 'flowerCount' to keep track of the number of flowers planted. Ensure that you correctly use loops to display flowers in neat rows and update the 'flowerCount' variable until all flowers are planted. Remember to print a message ‘Garden Complete!’ when all flowers are correctly in place.\n\n**Hint:** Pay attention to the use of loops and variables to maintain sequence and avoid over-complication. Your garden will only grow if you apply the right logic!",
      "reasoning": "To form a perfect rectangle, we need to determine the total number of flowers by multiplying the width and the length of the rectangle. The rectangle is 7 flowers wide and 9 flowers long. Therefore, the total number of flowers required equals 7 multiplied by 9, which is 63.\nIn the Scratch game, we will initialize a variable 'flowerCount' to track the number of flowers planted. We will use a loop that runs 63 times, each time incrementing the 'flowerCount'. The flowers should be displayed in neat rows and, once all 63 are planted, the game will display a message saying ‘Garden Complete!’.",

      "question": "Begin the 'Code Wizard's Potion Quest'! The wizard needs your help to brew a potion by mixing the right number of ingredients using both math and programming skills.\n\n**Math Puzzle:** The potion requires the wizard to mix `4 types of ingredients`. The first type needs `3 units`, the second type requires `5 units`, the third type needs `2 times` the second type, and the fourth type is the total of all previous types. Calculate the total number of units needed for all ingredients.\n\n**Scratch Game Challenge:** Design a game in Scratch where the wizard goes through stages mixing the calculated units for each ingredient. Use variables to hold the number of units for each type and create loops to represent mixing each ingredient exactly. Ensure your code accurately reflects the mathematical operations defined and keeps the logical sequence clear. End the game with a ‘Potion Ready!’ message when the mixing is complete.\n\n**Hint:** Identify the simplest logic path and use loops wisely to avoid complexity. Stay aligned with the mathematical solution for each game iteration!",
      "reasoning": "First, calculate each ingredient's requirement: \n- First type: 3 units\n- Second type: 5 units\n- Third type: 2 times the second, so 2 * 5 = 10 units\n- Fourth type: Sum of all previous units = 3 + 5 + 10 = 18 units\nThe total number of units required is the sum of these amounts: 3 + 5 + 10 + 18 = 36 units.\nIn the Scratch game, we need to create variables for each type (Type1, Type2, Type3, Type4) initialized to 3, 5, 10, and 18, respectively. Use loops to represent the mixing of each ingredient type and ensure the sequence is logical. Finally, display ‘Potion Ready!’ once all the mixing stages are complete.",

      "question": "Welcome to the 'Number Line Jumper' challenge! Help your character jump along the number line by solving number problems and translating them into game logic.\n\n**Math Puzzle:** If the character starts at position `0` on a number line and needs to jump forward `3 steps` and then backward `2 steps`, repeatedly for `5 cycles`, where does the character end on the number line? Calculate the final position.\n\n**Scratch Game Challenge:** Translate this scenario into a Scratch game by creating a loop to model these jumps. Use a variable 'position' to track your character’s location after each jump. Include a condition within your loop ensuring the jumps reflect the pattern \\(+3, -2\\), repeated 5 times. Upon reaching the final position calculated, print 'Journey Ended at Position ___!', filling in where the character lands.\n\n**Hint:** Focus on efficient loop structure and conditionals within your Scratch code. Consistency in logic will ensure the character lands in the right place!",
      "reasoning": "The character starts at position 0. In each cycle, the character jumps forward by 3 steps and then backward by 2 steps, resulting in a net move of 1 step forward per cycle. For 5 cycles: 1 position forward per cycle * 5 cycles = 5 positions forward. Thus, the character ends at position 5.\nIn the Scratch implementation, we initialize a variable 'position' starting at 0, and use a loop that iterates 5 times. Within each iteration, add 3 to 'position', then subtract 2, mimicking the jumps. Finally, display ‘Journey Ended at Position 5!’ to indicate the character's final location.",
