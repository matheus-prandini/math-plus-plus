Example Problem: Create a Scratch program that iterates over a list of numbers and performs an action only when a specific condition is met, using minimal blocks and avoiding unnecessary complexity."

Example Problem: Given a complex problem, outline the steps needed to solve it, then implement each step in Scratch, ensuring each part is tested and debugged before moving on."
