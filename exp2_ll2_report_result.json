      "error_pattern": "Students frequently make errors in basic arithmetic operations, particularly with multiplication and division, leading to incorrect results.",
      "recommendation": "Training Focus: Practice multiplication and division through repetitive exercises and real-world problem scenarios. Example Problem: Calculate the total cost of 5 items, each priced at $3.75, and determine the change from a $20 bill."

      "error_pattern": "Misinterpretation of problem constraints and requirements, resulting in solving the wrong problem or incorrect application of formulas.",
      "recommendation": "Training Focus: Enhance comprehension skills by practicing reading and interpreting word problems. Example Problem: A train travels 60 miles in 1.5 hours. What is its average speed? Ensure students understand the relationship between distance, time, and speed."

      "error_pattern": "Inefficient use of loops and conditionals in Scratch, leading to redundant code and increased complexity.",
      "recommendation": "Training Focus: Simplify logic by practicing the use of loops and conditionals effectively. Example Problem: Create a Scratch program that counts from 1 to 10 and displays each number. Encourage the use of a single loop to achieve this."
